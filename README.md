# Movies List

## Description
The Movies List app allows a user to view a list of movies, listed alphabetically. Then, the user can click on each image to see a detailed description of the selected movie. On the description page of each movie, a genre will also be displayed. From the description page, the user can click "Back to List" that will bring the user back to the full list of movies.

In future iterations, the user will be able to edit the description of a selected movie and save it to replace the current description.
